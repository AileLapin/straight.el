## Contributing

Please do! Development takes place on the `develop` branch. You can
switch to that branch with

    (setq straight-repository-branch "develop")

and base your pull requests from it. Please try to follow the style of
the surrounding code and documentation, but anything is welcome.

You can run the linting locally simply by running

    $ make

(although first you should make sure there is a suitable `emacs`
binary on your path, and you have
installed [`markdown-toc`][markdown-toc]).
